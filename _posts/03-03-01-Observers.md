The best way to add code to Magento is to make use of the events system.  This allows custom code to be fired upon receipt of an event without having to rewrite models or blocks.

Developing with observers means that the code is more independent and less likely to conflict with other extensions.

Take a look at this [events cheat sheet](http://www.nicksays.co.uk/magento-events-cheat-sheet-1-7/) for an idea of where events are fired.
